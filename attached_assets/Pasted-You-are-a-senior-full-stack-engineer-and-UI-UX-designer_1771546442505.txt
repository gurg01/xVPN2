TASK:
I have uploaded 3 images. Use them ONLY as visual guides to **write the app UI**, do NOT display them in the app.

1. **Image 1:** Onboarding screen  
   - Build a **3-slide carousel** in `Onboarding.js`  
   - Each slide must match the layout, colors, and typography from Image 1  
   - Include smooth swipe/slide animation  

2. **Image 2:** Main Dashboard  
   - Use this as the blueprint for `Home.jsx`  
   - Recreate layout, buttons (especially the 'Connect' button), spacing, and styling  
   - Make it fully interactive  

3. **Image 3:** Login/Signup Page  
   - Recreate the style, layout, input fields, and buttons for login and signup forms  
   - Must match colors, typography, and spacing exactly

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

- Use React or React Native (Expo compatible)  
- Functional components + hooks  
- Fully styled using CSS / Tailwind CSS or StyleSheet  
- Components must be reusable  
- Implement validation, loading states, and navigation between pages  
- Make responsive for mobile screens  

--------------------------------------------------
FLOATING LABELS (Sign In / Sign Up / Forgot Password)
--------------------------------------------------

1. **Behavior:**  
   - When input is empty, label sits inside the box like a placeholder  
   - When user clicks or types, label animates upward to top-left of input and shrinks  
   - Smooth CSS transition (0.2s ease-in-out)  

2. **Style:**  
   - Use xVPN "Deep Space" dark background theme  
   - Label color changes to bright cyan / neon blue when active  

3. **Code:**  
   - Implement using Tailwind CSS `peer-placeholder-shown` or standard CSS transitions  
   - Apply to **Email**, **Password**, **New Password**, **Confirm Password**, and any input field on Sign In, Sign Up, and Forgot Password pages  

--------------------------------------------------
BACKEND / AUTH REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

- Secure email/password handling  
- Password hashing (bcrypt)  
- Email verification codes sent to **newly registered users** and **existing users**  
- Forgot Password flow fully implemented with rate limiting and validation  
- Endpoints:  
  - POST /auth/register  
  - POST /auth/forgot-password  
  - POST /auth/verify-code  
  - POST /auth/reset-password
